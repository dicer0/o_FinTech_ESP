What is interest?
When you request money from the bank or contract a financial product, that is, when you lend money to the bank usually to increase our own capital (stocks, investment funds, insurance, savings accounts, etc.), it is necessary to take into account that, when returning the capital to the bank or recovering the investment, an additional amount is added, usually described in the form of a percentage. This amount is known as interest.

What is credit?
The term "credit" refers to the ability of a person or company to obtain goods, services, or borrowed money with the promise of repaying it in the future, usually with additional interest. In simple terms, credit is the trust granted to an individual or entity to acquire resources in the present with the obligation to pay for them in the future. This trust always involves risk and is a term widely used in finance.

How do banks work and how do they make money?
In a very simplified way, banks simply receive money deposits from people and with that money, they can make loans to other individuals. Banks make money by offering lower interest rates to people from whom they receive money and contract a financial product and charging higher interest rates to people to whom they lend money. The remainder of the interest on lending and receiving money allows the bank to cover its operating costs, protects it from the risk of lending money to people (giving them credit), and ultimately generates profit.
The interest on loans made by the bank is usually paid in the long term and this is considered as an asset (money that belongs to the bank).
But the money and interest from deposits made to the bank, whether a financial product has been contracted or not, must be paid when the person requires it, which is why it is considered a liability (money that is a debt of the bank because it must be returned to the person who made the deposit).
Capital is the result of subtracting the bank's assets from its liabilities.
Capital = Interest_Loans - Interest_Deposits = Assets - Liabilities
The liquidity of the bank.
